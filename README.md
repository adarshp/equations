Equations
=========

The `equations` package aims to allow parsing of equations in PDFs of technical
and scientific documents. It utilizes techniques from both computer vision and
natural language processing to identify the equations and to ground their
variables to scientific concepts.

In the bigger picture, `equations` serves as a proof of concept for extracting
information stored in the form of structured objects (including equations,
tables, and charts) in PDF documents.

`equations` is being developed as part of the
[AutoMATES](https://ml4ai.github.io/automates/) project at the University of
Arizona.
